## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun challenge to complete. I did follow [Kevin Powell's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8&t=1703s) whilst making adjustments within my code along the way. Despite having a good level of understanding regarding HTML and CSS, I learned some new concepts in regards to the SVGs such as the `space` property within `background-repeat` which is very useful and will most likely use in future projects. I also used both the `flex` and `grid` property to rearrange the elements into sections to help make the webpage responsive and look as similar to the design as possible. Overall, I really enjoyed this challenge and have taken a lot of new concepts into consideration and will use them in future projects.

CSS - : 

```css

.ratings li::before  {
    content: "";
    width: 6.25rem;
    height: 1rem;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: block;
    background-image: url('/images/icon-star.svg');
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    background-repeat: space;
}

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I need to learn more complex concepts and utilise those within future projects. Also, I should form a habit of writing clean codes in HTML regarding the semantics as well as Javascript, to prevent repetitive codes and to make it easier to read. Also, I should begin taking on more challenging responsive projects to test my layout skills.
